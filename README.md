# Snake Game

## This is a version of the snake game

Error #1: So far I am trying to create the board for the snake game, however, whenever I run the program, I am not seeing the bottom half of the board.

Solution #1: okay so I found out that for some reason, the debugger terminal doesn't clear the terminal screen for whatever reason. Hence, if you are in VS code, you can run the program to compile it and then in your terminal, run `main.exe` and it should run fine. if you run into an infinte loop, use ctrl c.
